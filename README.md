# Jai OpenGL Demo

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ck2bvbOGXHA/default.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ck2bvbOGXHA)

## Running the demo
You can run the demo by either double clicking the .exe under the "run_tree" directory or by the following command:
`C:\jaiOpenGLTest> .\run.bat`

### Controls
| Input | Action |
| ----- | ------ |
| Mouse | Aim Camera |
| WASD | Camera Movement |
| Backspace | Exit program |
(Backspace because of my keyboard :))

## Building
Unfortunately jai isn't released to the public just yet. So if you don't have the compiler, you're out of luck!
Otherwise you just do:
`C:\jaiOpenGLTest> .\build.bat`
