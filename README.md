## Running the demo
You can run the demo by either double clicking the .exe under the "run_tree" directory or by the following command:

```bash
.\run.bat
```

### Controls
| Input | Action |
| ----- | ------ |
| Mouse | Aim Camera |
| WASD | Camera Movement |
| Backspace | Exit program |

(Backspace because of my keyboard :D)

## Building
Unfortunately jai isn't released to the public just yet. So if you don't have the compiler, you're out of luck!
Otherwise you just do:

```bash
.\build.bat
```
